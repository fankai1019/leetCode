# TODO list

This is the to do list for learning algorithms.

1. [ ] Implement a hash table
2. [x] Check why the amortized time for appending to an array is constant
3. [ ] read hash table collision
4. [ ] review space complexity of recursive call for 17.4
5. [ ] understand why list can't be sorted as sort(list.begin(), list.end())
6. [ ] learn backtracking search
7. [ ] dfs bfs recursvie to iteration 
8. [ ] check master theory and read https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/discuss/35691/The-bottom-up-O(N)-solution-would-be-better
